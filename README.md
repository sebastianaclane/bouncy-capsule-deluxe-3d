# Bouncy Capsule Deluxe 3D

A 3D Platformer game I developed between January - March 2022. Designed 3 levels of increasing difficulty where you platform your way to the blue rectangle finish line. Collect as many coins as you can and avoid the tyranny of the headcrabs or jump on their heads! 

# What I Learned

* Developing and deploying a game in the Unity Engine
* Followed along the "Build Your First 3D Game in Unity | Unity Beginner Tutorial by Coding In Flow" YouTube tutorial series to create the game: https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLrnPJCHvNZuB5ATsJZLKX3AW4V9XaIV9b
* Designing platformer levels with mechanics such as wall jumping and bouncy platforms while increasing the difficulty each level
* Using Time.deltaTime can be used to rotate an object while being frame independent
* Creating C# scripts involving collision methods like OnTriggerEnter() and OnTriggerExit() and creating a waypoint follower logic to move certain platforms between two waypoints either vertically or horizontally
* Play testing and debugging the game

Note: To see the C# .cs scripts I created, navigate to Assets/Scripts directory.
